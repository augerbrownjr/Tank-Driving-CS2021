sample code works via receiving a lowercase character and using the equivilent of a goto command(boo) to trigger commands 


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);   
Serial1.begin(9600);   // put your setup code here, to run once:
}
void loop() {
  if(Serial1.available()){
   input = Serial1.read();
   if(input != 'S'){   
//Serial.println(input);
       if (isAlpha(input)){   
//Serial.println("alpha");
 switch(input){   
case 'S':
//commands for when "stop" is pressed on the bluetooth app
    break;
   case'F':    
//commands for when "Forward" is pressed
 break;   
case 'B':      
//commands for when "Back" is pressed
break;   
case 'L':
//commands for when "Left" is pressed
break;   
case'R':      
//commands for when "Right" is pressed
break;   
case 'G':      
//commands for when "Forward Left" is pressed
break;   
case 'H':      
//commands for when "Back Left" is pressed
break;   
case'I':      
//commands for when "Forward Right" is pressed
break;   
case 'J':     
//commands for when "Back Right" is pressed
break;   
// you may want to include other cases for values sent by the app.
 See the settings in the app for the other values sent.
case 'q':   
input = 58;  
//should return a numeric value that will be converted to the number 10 later in the sketch
 break;   
default:
  break;  
}   
}   
if (isDigit(input)||input == 58){ 
number = input; 
number = number - 48; 
//
Serial.println(number); 
//Commands for when slider is moved (range 0-10)
  }   
}   
} 
}
